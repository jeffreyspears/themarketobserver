    <p class="body-paragraph">I've got a passion for finance that began when 
        I was young. It's been a (relatively) long journey for me, and I've 
        consumed a lot of podcasts, articles, and shoptalk that I've never 
        really written down anywhere. Which brings me to this page. The goal 
        of this site is to record what I learn and insights that I come 
        across. Mostly for myself, but I suppose if anyone is reading this, 
        welcome to my website. I hope you find something of value here. </br></br>
        Another reason for this site is to continue learning. I enjoy 
        creative work and a quote I find amenable is, “any sufficiently 
        advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” HTML and CSS 
        may not be that advanced, but it certainly feels like magic to me. </br>
